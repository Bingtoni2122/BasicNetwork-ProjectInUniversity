Text Editor for Co-working/Remote Working

## Description
  This is our Basic Network project at University of Information Technology - UIT.
  
  We write an Text Editor app for co-working in C#. It can allow many people text in the same time, have auto correct words, auto trim and a little bit against collision. 

  We tested in using LAN for texting and it worked fine. Hope u enjoy this.

## How to Install and Run the Project
  Clone this repo and run in IDE (We used Visual Studio).
